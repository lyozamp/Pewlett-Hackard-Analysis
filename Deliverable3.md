# Employee Database Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program at a company called Pewlett-Hackard. This will help the company estimate the number of retirement packages they might have to offer, along with identifying which positions will need to be filled. Due to the company's size, a sudden surge in retiring employees could leave a huge need in the day to day operations. Conducting this analysis now helps Pewlett-Hackard plan and protect themselves from sudden shocks to their business and see who is eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results: 
To determine the requirement criteria, we combined several datasets and then filtered them to only show employees born between 1952-1955. From there, the combined dataset was organized by job title, and the potential retirees in each title were totaled. A second table was constructed from the original six datasets to identify employees born in the year 1965 who are still with Pewlett-Hackard. These employees are potential candidates for a mentorship program, where a retiring employee trains them to fill the position they are leaving.

### Employees Retiring by Title 
- The most urgent item Pewlett-Hackard needs to address is the possibility of almost 45,000 engineers retiring. Right now, they have 29,414 employees with the title of Senior Engineer who meet the criteria for a near-future retirement. There are also 14,222 employees with the title of Engineer who also meet the criteria. A plan needs to be put into place to attract middle and senior level engineers to fill these roles. Promoting internally is an option, but that will be tough given the number of middle level engineers potentially retiring.
- Middle management will be unaffected by possible retirement. There are only two employees with the title of manager who meet the criteria for potential retirement. Pewlett-Hackard can look to existing managers to potentially fill Senior Leadership positions that might open. There are 28,254 employees with the title of Senior Staff who meet the retirement criteria.

### Mentorship Possibilities
- The mentorship program would not be able to fill all the positions potentially opening. Under the current criteria, there are only 1,549 employees who could be mentored. With 14,222 mid-level engineering positions opening, this would be insufficient for just that one role, let alone across the whole company.
- It also does not consider if the employees are ready to be mentored and to transition into more senior positions. Some employees do hit a ceiling in terms of career advancement. Others might have only recently been promoted to their current position and might not have enough experience to be promoted again. The query we used does provide a list of employees for mentoring, but it is limited by these factors.

## Summary: 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
