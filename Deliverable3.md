# Employee Database Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program at a company called Pewlett-Hackard. This will help the company estimate the number of retirement packages they might have to offer, along with identifying which positions will need to be filled. Due to the company's size, a sudden surge in retiring employees could leave a huge need in the day to day operations. Conducting this analysis now helps Pewlett-Hackard plan and protect themselves from sudden shocks to their business and see who is eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
